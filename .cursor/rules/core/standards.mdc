# Git Practices

- **Commit Messages:** ALWAYS use `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, or `chore:` prefixes.
- **Verification:** NEVER use `--no-verify` or bypass pre-commit hooks.
- **Pushing Code:** NEVER push failing tests to the repository.
- **Avoid Interactive:** NEVER use `git rebase --continue`, `git commit --amend`, or other interactive commands. You do not have access to the interactive terminal.
**REMEMBER: Use semantic commit prefixes, respect pre-commit hooks, ensure tests pass before pushing, and avoid interactive git commands.**

# Testing Standards

- **Execution:** Always run tests in single-run mode (no watch mode).
- **Failure:** Prefer to fail-fast (e.g., "bail=1" or equivalent).

**REMEMBER: Run tests in single-run mode and configure them to fail fast on first error.**

# Package Managers

- **Default:** Use `npm` unless explicitly specified otherwise.

**REMEMBER: Always use npm as the default package manager for all operations.**

# Rule Management Standards

- **File Extensions:** Always use `.mdc` extension for Cursor rules.
- **Always Apply:** Mark core rules with `alwaysApply: true` for consistent behavior.
- **Glob Patterns:** Use specific glob patterns to target relevant files and directories.
- **Rule Organization:** Group related rules in logical folder structures with index files.

# Memory System Standards

- **Context Preservation:** Always store important decisions and patterns in `.cursor/docs/memory/`.
- **Rule Dependencies:** Reference other rules using `@rule-name.mdc` syntax.
- **Version Control:** Commit rule changes with semantic prefixes for tracking.
- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date rule documentation and changelogs.

# Integration Development Standards

- **Security First:** Always validate inputs and follow secure coding practices.
- **Test Coverage:** Ensure comprehensive testing of all entity types and API interactions.
- **Documentation:** Maintain README.md, configuration docs, and usage examples.
- **CLI Tools:** Use established CLI tools and test-runner.js for validation.

# Code Quality Standards

- **File Size:** Keep files under 1000 lines to prevent bloat and complexity.
- **Dead Code:** Always delete unused code instead of hiding it with CSS or comments.
- **Clean Removal:** Remove features entirely rather than using `display: none` or commenting out.
- **Organization:** Maintain clear file structure and update project documentation regularly.

**REMEMBER: Follow all standards consistently, maintain security practices, and use established tools for validation.**
