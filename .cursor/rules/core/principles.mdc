# Guiding Principles

1. **We do test-driven development, one test at a time:** 1. write a red failing test first; THEN 2. write the code and run tests until you have a green passing test; THEN 3. refactor code if needed. Commit, then move to the next test.
2. **Micro-Milestones:** We do TDD. So you must perform work in commit-sized chunks. Optimize for easy rewinding. 
3. **Observability:** Add excessive logging whilst working on a task. We must delete logs before a commit.
4. **Many Small Files:** ALWAYS prefer creating new files over adding to existing ones. 
5. **Human-readable over DRY:** we want DRY code, but not at the expense of it being human-readable.
6. **Use JSDocs:** for new code that you write.

# Code Quality & Maintenance
7. **Dead Code Prevention:** Always delete unused code instead of hiding it. Remove unused UI components, functions, and imports completely.
8. **File Size Management:** Keep files under 1000 lines. Split large files into focused modules.
9. **Bloat Prevention:** Avoid creating bloated files with unnecessary complexity. Prefer simple, focused implementations.
10. **Clean Removal:** When removing features, delete the code entirely rather than using CSS `display: none` or commenting out.

# Organization & Focus
11. **Project Structure:** Maintain clear file organization and update project documentation regularly.
12. **Context Preservation:** Use Build.md, Task.md, and PageList.md to maintain project focus and prevent getting lost in details.
13. **Memory Management:** Implement proper memory systems to prevent forgetting important context and decisions.
14. **Goal Tracking:** Regularly reference original goals to prevent scope creep and maintain direction.

# Integration-Specific Principles
15. **Security First:** Always validate inputs, sanitize data, and follow secure coding practices for API integrations.
16. **Test Coverage:** Ensure comprehensive testing of entity types, API responses, and error scenarios.
17. **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date README.md, configuration docs, and usage examples.
18. **CLI Tools:** Use established CLI tools and test-runner.js for validation rather than manual processes.

**REMEMBER: TDD. Make everything observable. Keep files small and focused. Work in reversible increments. And write tests before code.**
